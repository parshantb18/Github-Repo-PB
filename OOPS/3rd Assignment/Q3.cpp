/*Verify the following about destructor by writing the program:
 (i)Name should begin with tilde sign(~) and must match class name.
 (ii)There cannot be more than one destructor in a class.
 (iii)Destructors do not allow any parameter.
 (iv)They do not have any return type, just like constructors.
 
When you do not specify any destructor in a class, compiler generates a default 
destructor and inserts it into your code.*/
